# Questions

  - Micro vs. nano
  - Plan for integrity check:
    + Have registry save checksum. Endpoint for getting checksum
    + Calculate checksum of package before installing
    + Possibly calculate checksum before starting
  - Yarn appears to be doing the following:
    + Save checksum of tarballs in lockfile
    + SHA1 checksum of lockfile
    + Checksum before installing
    + I'm sceptical of how much this actually helps. Assumes that project
      files can be trusted. Having it get from the registry each time will make
      it harder to just overwrite everything.
  - Did hooks
  - Did iface deps
  - Did lockfiles


What about parametric services that work with parametric interfaces. I think
we might need to make references to these in a specific way. I'm on the side
of proposing new syntax that looks a bit like a function, and goes in the
interfaces attribute in the output port.
